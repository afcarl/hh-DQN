# hh-DQN

This my hierarchy DQN implementation. Because there are already some models called h-DQN, I have no choice but to call my model HH-DQN to emphasize the hierarchy property of my model. The essential difference between hh-DQN and their so called h-DQN is that my hierarchy is not constrained on two layers: subgoal and goal. Moreover, the subgoal is not pre-defined. I expect the model can learn suitable subgoal from the random walking between states.
